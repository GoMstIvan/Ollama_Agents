# ollama_client.py Documentation

## Overview

`ollama_client.py` is a Python module that provides a client interface for interacting with the Ollama language model service. It handles sending prompts to the model, receiving and processing the responses, and formatting the output for display in a terminal environment.

## Key Components

### Libraries Used

1. **requests**: Used for making HTTP requests to the Ollama API.
2. **json**: Used for parsing JSON responses from the API.
3. **logging**: Used for logging information and errors.
4. **shutil**: Used to get the terminal size for text wrapping.
5. **rich**: Used for enhanced console output, including live updating and text styling.

### Classes

#### OllamaClient

The main class that handles communication with the Ollama service.

- **Initialization**: Sets up the base URL for the Ollama API and initializes a Console object from the rich library.
- **process_prompt**: The primary method for sending a prompt to the model and processing the response.

#### TextStreamer

A utility class for handling the streaming output of text from the model.

- **Initialization**: Sets up the initial state for streaming text, including the maximum width for text wrapping.
- **add_text**: Processes incoming text, handling line wrapping and preserving original formatting.
- **get_output**: Returns the current state of the processed text.

### Functions

#### process_prompt

A wrapper function that uses the default OllamaClient instance to process prompts.

## Functionality

1. **API Interaction**: The module sends POST requests to the Ollama API with the given prompt and model parameters.

2. **Streaming Response Handling**: It processes the API response in a streaming fashion, allowing for real-time display of the model's output.

3. **Text Formatting**: The TextStreamer class handles formatting of the output text, including:
   - Preserving original newlines from the model's output.
   - Wrapping text to fit the terminal width without breaking words across lines.
   - Handling tokens of varying lengths, including spaces and punctuation.

4. **Live Display**: Utilizes the rich library's Live display to update the console in real-time as new text is received.

5. **Error Handling**: Includes error handling for API connection issues and unexpected responses.

6. **Logging**: Implements logging for important events and errors, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

## Importance of Formatting Output

Proper formatting of the output is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Readability**: Well-formatted text is easier to read and understand, especially in a terminal environment where space may be limited.

2. **Word Integrity**: Keeping words intact (not split across lines) is important for maintaining the meaning and flow of the text.

3. **Preserving Model Intent**: By respecting newlines in the model's output, we maintain any intentional formatting or structure in the response.

4. **Adaptability**: The text wrapping adapts to different terminal sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across various environments.

5. **Real-time Feedback**: Streaming the formatted output provides immediate feedback to the user, enhancing the interactive experience.

6. **Aesthetic Consistency**: Proper formatting contributes to a polished, professional appearance of the application.

The current implementation in ollama_client.py strikes a balance between these factors, prioritizing word integrity and original formatting while ensuring the output fits within the terminal constraints.

## Conclusion

ollama_client.py serves as a robust interface between a Python application and the Ollama language model service. Its careful handling of text streaming and formatting ensures a smooth, readable output that respects both the model's output and the constraints of the terminal environment.
