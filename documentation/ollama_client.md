## 📜 The Art of Word Wrapping in REPLs

Ah, word wrapping in REPLs (Read-Eval-Print Loops) - it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole sometimes! 🔄🧩

### The Chunky Challenge 🍫

In the world of language models, text comes in bite-sized pieces called tokens. But here's the catch: tokens don't always play nice with our human concept of words! 

```
Token 1: "Super"
Token 2: "cali"
Token 3: "fragilistic"
Token 4: "expiali"
Token 5: "docious"
```

See the problem? We don't know if we need a line break until we've seen all the tokens that make up a word or sentence. It's like trying to solve a puzzle without seeing all the pieces! 🧩

### Our Solution: Better Safe Than Sorry! 🦺

In our `TextStreamer`, we've taken the "better safe than sorry" approach. We'd rather keep words intact than split them across lines. It might not be perfect, but it's way better than seeing:

```
Supercalifragilistic
expialidocious
```

Instead, we aim for:

```
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
```

It's not always pretty, but it keeps the meaning intact! 💪

## 🎉 Conclusion

`ollama_client.py` is your ticket to the AI carnival! 🎟️ It handles the nitty-gritty of talking to Ollama, makes sure the response looks good, and even juggles words to keep them whole. It's not just a module; it's a magical AI experience in your terminal! ✨🖥️
