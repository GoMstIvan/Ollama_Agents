```

## 4. 🧱 Core Components

### 4.1 Main Application (`src/main.py`)
- Entry point of the application
- Manages the overall flow and agent selection

### 4.2 Agents (`src/agents/`)
- `multi_agent.py`: Implements multi-agent functionality
- `one_agent.py`: Implements single agent functionality

### 4.3 Modules (`src/modules/`)
- `assemble.py`: Handles prompt assembly and history management
- `banner.py`: Manages CLI visual elements
- `basic_commands.py`: Implements core slash commands
- `chunk_history.py`: Manages document chunk history
- `ddg_search.py`: Integrates DuckDuckGo search functionality
- `document_commands.py`: Handles document-related operations
- `fabric_commands.py`: Integrates Fabric pattern functionality
- `file_utils.py`: Provides file handling utilities
- `input.py`: Manages user input processing
- `memory_commands.py`: Implements memory-related operations
- `memory_search.py`: Handles memory search functionality
- `ollama_client.py`: Manages communication with Ollama API
- `save_history.py`: Handles saving and loading of chat history
- `slash_commands.py`: Implements slash command processing

## 5. 🔄 Data Flow

1. User input (`input.py`) → Main application (`main.py`)
2. Command processing (`slash_commands.py`) or agent interaction
3. If agent interaction:
   a. Prompt assembly (`assemble.py`)
   b. API communication (`ollama_client.py`)
   c. Response processing and display

## 6. 🧠 Memory Management

- Short-term memory: Managed in `save_history.py`
- Long-term memory: Implemented through document chunks and embeddings
- Memory search: Implemented in `memory_search.py`

## 7. 🔍 Search Functionality

- Memory search: `/ms` and `/msl` commands
- Web search: Integrated through `ddg_search.py`

## 8. 🎨 User Interface

- CLI interface with rich formatting (`banner.py`)
- Interactive input handling (`input.py`)
- Customizable prompt style

## 9. 🔧 Extensibility

- New agents can be added to the `agents/` directory
- Additional modules can be integrated into the `modules/` directory
- Fabric patterns can be added through the `/fabric` command

## 10. 🔐 Configuration

- Central configuration managed in `config.py`
- Environment variables for sensitive information

## 11. 🧪 Testing

- Comprehensive test suite in `src/tests/`
- Covers core functionalities and modules
- Run tests using: `python -m unittest discover src/tests`

## 12. 🛠️ Customization Points

- 🎭 **Personality**: Tweak `config.py` to adjust your AI's persona
- 🧠 **AI Model**: Modify `ollama_client.py` to use different AI backends
- 🌈 **Appearance**: Customize `banner.py` for a unique look
- 🔍 **Search Engine**: Extend `ddg_search.py` to add more search providers

## 13. 🚀 Scaling Up

As your AI assistant grows, consider:

1. 📊 Database integration for long-term memory
2. 🌐 API endpoints for web/mobile interfaces
3. 🧠 Multiple AI models for specialized tasks
4. 🔒 Enhanced security features
5. 🔧 Performance optimizations for large-scale deployments

## 14. 🎉 Conclusion

Ollama_Agents is designed to be both powerful and playful. Each module plays a crucial role, and together they create an AI assistant that's greater than the sum of its parts. This architecture allows for easy customization and extension, making it a versatile platform for building AI assistants.

Remember to keep your tests up-to-date as you add new features or modify existing ones. This will ensure the continued reliability and maintainability of your AI assistant.

Happy building! 🏗️✨
