Here's a suggested approach to streamline the reasoning process using llama3.1:

1. Keep the high-level reasoning functions that define the overall structure and flow of the reasoning process. These include:

   - perform_causal_analysis
   - generate_hypotheses
   - test_hypotheses
   - find_analogies
   - detect_contradictions
   - resolve_contradictions
   - perform_deductive_reasoning
   - perform_inductive_reasoning
   - perform_abductive_reasoning
   - generate_counterfactuals
   - assess_probability
   - evaluate_ethical_implications
   - analyze_system_dynamics
   - identify_patterns
   - evaluate_reasoning_process
   - apply_analogy
   - make_decision
   - abstract_concept

2. Instead of using the helper functions to implement these reasoning processes, we can craft prompts that leverage llama3.1's capabilities. For example:

```python
from src.modules.ollama_client import process_prompt

class ReasoningEngine:
    def __init__(self, model_name="llama3.1:latest"):
        self.model_name = model_name

    def perform_causal_analysis(self, context: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        prompt = f"""
        Perform a causal analysis on the following context:

        {context}

        Identify potential cause-and-effect relationships. For each relationship, provide:
        1. The cause
        2. The effect
        3. A brief explanation of the relationship
        4. A confidence score (0-1) for this causal link

        Format your response as a JSON list of objects with the following structure:
        [
            {{
                "cause": "Identified cause",
                "effect": "Resulting effect",
                "explanation": "Brief explanation of the relationship",
                "confidence": 0.8
            }},
            ...
        ]
        """
        response = process_prompt(prompt, self.model_name, "CausalAnalyzer")
        return json.loads(response)

    # Implement other reasoning methods similarly...
```

3. This approach allows us to:
   - Leverage the full capabilities of llama3.1 for complex reasoning tasks.
   - Simplify our codebase by removing many of the helper functions.
   - Easily adjust or expand reasoning capabilities by modifying prompts.
   - Maintain a consistent interface for different reasoning tasks.

4. For some tasks that require specific data structures or algorithms (like graph operations for system dynamics analysis), we might keep some helper functions. But we can minimize these and use them in conjunction with llama3.1's reasoning capabilities.

5. We should still maintain error handling, logging, and any necessary post-processing of llama3.1's outputs to ensure they fit our required formats and standards.

This approach allows us to take full advantage of llama3.1's advanced reasoning capabilities while maintaining the structure and modularity of our reasoning engine. It also makes it easier to upgrade to even more advanced models in the future, as we'd primarily need to adjust prompts rather than rewrite complex logic.
