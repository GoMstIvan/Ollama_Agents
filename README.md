Build Your Own AI Agent from Libraries of Functions! 🛠️

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to AI_Functions! 🎉 This repository is your treasure trove of modular functions designed to create a spectacular AI agent for Ollama. By organizing these functions into separate modules, we're providing you with a LEGO-like 🧱 framework for building your dream AI assistant!

## 🔧 Configuration

Personalize your AI buddy by tweaking the `config.py` file. Want to name your AI agent "Jarvis" or "Friday"? Go ahead! Open `config.py` and let your imagination run wild! 🌈

## 🧪 Running Tests

Quality is our middle name! 💪 To ensure your AI agent is in tip-top shape, we've included a comprehensive test suite. Here's how to run it:

1. 🏃‍♂️ Sprint to your project root directory in the terminal.
2. 🚀 Launch the tests with this cosmic command:

   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover src/tests
   ```

Watch in awe as it automatically discovers and runs all test files in the `src/tests` directory! 🎭

## 🔑 Key Features

### 🎤 Input Module (`input.py`)

The `input.py` file is the rockstar 🎸 of our AI agent. It's got more features than a Swiss Army knife:

1. **Flexible Input Handling**: Using `prompt_toolkit`, it creates a command-line interface so cool, you'll think you're in a sci-fi movie! 🖥️

2. **Command Recognition**: It understands special commands like '/help', '/exit', and '/quit'. It's like it can read your mind! 🧠

3. **Error Handling**: Keyboard interrupts? EOF conditions? Ha! This module eats those for breakfast. 🍳

4. **Help Function**: Lost? No worries! Our built-in help function is like a friendly tour guide for your AI journey. 🗺️
